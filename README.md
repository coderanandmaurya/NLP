## 🚀 What You Can Learn

This repository is designed for learners at all levels — from beginners to advanced students:

### 📘 Fundamentals

* **Introduction to NLP** — what NLP is, why it matters, and core terminologies. ([GitHub][1])
* **NLP Pipeline** — step-by-step guide from raw text to deployed model. ([GitHub][1])

### 🔍 Core NLP Tasks

* **Text Preprocessing** — cleaning, normalizing, tokenizing text before modeling. ([GitHub][1])
* **Tokenization** — splitting text into words or sub-tokens (with notebook). ([GitHub][1])
* **Text Representation** — Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings. ([GitHub][1])

### 🧠 Classic Learning Methods

* **Stemming & Lemmatization** — reduce words to base forms. ([GitHub][1])
* **Text Classification** — supervised learning for sentiment and topic classification. ([GitHub][1])
* **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging** — HMM and Viterbi explained and demonstrated. ([GitHub][1])

### 🤖 Word Embeddings

* **Word2Vec** basics for representing semantic meaning in vectors. ([GitHub][1])
